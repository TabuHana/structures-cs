		<p>
			A Linked List is a sequencial collection of elements. Each element is called a Node and each node has two pieces of information. The data value itself and a pointer that references the new node in the list. A Linked List has a head and a tail. The head node points to the second node, which points to the third node and so on until you reach the tail node, which points to null indicating the end of the list. 
			To be more specific what I just described is a singly linked list where each node has 1 pointer to the next node in the list. There are also Doubly Linked Lists where each node has a pointer to the next node and a second pointer to the previous node. So the doubly linked list has one more piece of information than a singly linked list. This reference to the previous node allows it to be traversed both forward and backward, unlike the singly linked list which can only be traversed forward. Additionally, just as the tail node has a next pointer to null in the doubly linked list the head node also has a previous pointer to null.
			One real world application of the linked list might be a music player where each song is a node in the linked list that has a reference to the next and the previous song. in fact the music playlist might actually be a splical type of linked list called a circular linked list. Where the head and tail nodes actually points to each other rather than to null.

		<p>Why use a linked list at all, why not use a array. The difference has to do with how they're stored in memory. Arrays support direct access, while a linked list supports seuential access. a true array is allocated in a contiguous block of memory. Meaning each element in the array is located right next to each other. Because of  this its easy to grab any element in the array whether its at possition 3 or possition 100. To get to element 100, you can easily just jump to that position. You don't need to step through the first 99 elements. Since linked lists have sequencial access, so each element in the list remembers its part of a specific order, but unlike in an array you can't just jump directly to a specific index in the list. This is the draw back of the linked list. The huge advantage of a linked list is because each node can be stored anywhere in memory, unlike in arrays, adding and removing elements is much faster in linked lists compared to arrays </p>
